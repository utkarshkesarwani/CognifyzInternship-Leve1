                 Artificial intelligence (AI), the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings.
                 he term is frequently applied to the project of developing systems endowed with the intellectual processes characteristic of humans, 
                 such as the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn from past experience.  
                 AI is a machineâ€™s ability to perform the cognitive functions we associate with human minds, such as perceiving, reasoning, 
                 learning, interacting with an environment,
                 problem solving, and even exercising creativity. Specific applications of AI include expert systems,
                 natural language processing, speech recognition and machine vision.
                 As the hype around AI has accelerated, vendors have been scrambling to promote how their products and services use it.
                 Often, what they refer to as AI is simply a component of the technology, such as machine learning. AI requires a foundation of 
                 specialized hardware and software for writing and training machine learning algorithms. No single programming language is 
                 synonymous with AI, but Python, R, Java, C++ and Julia have features popular with AI developers.
                 In general, AI systems work by ingesting large amounts of labeled training data, analyzing the data for correlations
                 and patterns, and using these patterns to make predictions about future states. In this way, a chatbot that is fed examples 
                 of text can learn to generate lifelike exchanges with people, or an image recognition tool can learn to identify and describe 
                 objects in images by reviewing millions of examples. New, rapidly improving generative AI techniques can create realistic text, 
                 images, music and other media.
